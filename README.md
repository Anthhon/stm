# STM - Secure Terminal Messenger

## Introduction

STM is a terminal-based application that uses the XMPP protocol for server-client communication and SSL/TLS for message encryption. The application is designed to provide end-to-end encryption for messages, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them.

## Requirements

- C compiler
- WolfSSL
- Libstrophe

## Roadmap

- [X] Create a basic UDP chat app
- [X] Implement some basic terminal interface
- [X] Implement basic message metadata
- [ ] Make it work at WAN network
- [ ] Search and fix some possible bugs

### Design the architecture of the application

- [X] Implement a prototype of a TCP chat
- [X] Implement multithreading to simultaneous conversation
- [X] Search and understand more about the XMPP and it's library 
- [ ] Determine how the client will connect to the XMPP server
- [ ] Plan how messages will be encrypted and decrypted using SSL/TLS
- [ ] Decide how to store user credentials securely

### Coding the application

- [ ] Write the code to establish a connection to the XMPP server
- [ ] Implement SSL/TLS encryption for messages
- [ ] Write code to handle user authentication and message exchange
- [ ] Develop any additional features you've identified in the roadmap section

### Test and refine the application

- [ ] Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as intended
- [ ] Refine the code to improve performance and user experience
- [ ] Incorporate feedback from beta testers, if applicable
