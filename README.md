# STM - Secure Terminal Messenger

## Introduction

STM is a terminal-based application that uses the XMPP protocol for server-client communication and SSL/TLS for message encryption. The application is designed to provide end-to-end encryption for messages, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them.

## Requirements

- C compiler
- WolfSSL
- Libstrophe

## Installation

Not possible yet.

## Usage

Not possible yet.

## Roadmap

### Set up development environment

- Install a C compiler on your system
- Download and install the WolfSSL library for SSL/TLS
- Download and install the Libstrophe library for XMPP

### Design the architecture of the application

- Determine how the client will connect to the XMPP server
- Plan how messages will be encrypted and decrypted using SSL/TLS
- Decide how to store user credentials securely

### Coding the application

- Write the code to establish a connection to the XMPP server
- Implement SSL/TLS encryption for messages
- Write code to handle user authentication and message exchange
- Develop any additional features you've identified in the roadmap section

### Test and refine the application

- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as intended
- Refine the code to improve performance and user experience
- Incorporate feedback from beta testers, if applicable
