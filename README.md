# STM - Secure Terminal Messenger

## Planning

- Familiarize myself with the XMPP protocol and the C language.

- Choose a library that supports XMPP protocol in C language. (Some popular XMPP libraries for C language include Libstrophe, Swiften, and Loudmouth.)

- Setting up a development environment for C language.

- Create a new project in your development environment and add the XMPP library to your project.

- Use the library to create an XMPP client that can connect to an XMPP server.

- Implement the XMPP protocol to enable sending and receiving messages using the client.

- Implement the TLS encryption protocol to secure the communication between the two users. (I can use an existing TLS library such as OpenSSL)

- Test the client application by connecting to an XMPP server and sending messages between two users.

- Optimize the client application for performance, security, and user experience.

- Document the entire application so users have to know how to set up their own XMPP server.

- Deploy the application in some security groups so user can founds bugs and breaches

- Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the client application.
